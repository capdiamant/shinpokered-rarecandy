# Fork of Shin Pokémon Red, Blue, Green, Red-JP, & Blue-JP

Fork to provide free rare candies on PokeMarts

Version 1.23

*Shin (真) - The kanji for "true".  
Used in Japanese media to denote a remastering, updated retelling , or a "true form" of something.*  

     This is an enhancement ROM hack of Pokemon Red & Blue based on the Pret team's pokered disassembly project.
It is a mostly-vanilla hack that focuses on fixing game engine bugs and oversights from the original game.
Additionally, trainer AI routines are improved and multiple quality-of-life enhancements have been added.
It also acts as a kind of research-informed speculative work that presents an alternate interpretation of the games.
Specifically, that being what the 2016 Nintendo Virtual Console re-release of Gen-1 Pokemon could have been.
It is the image of a glitch-free experience with player-friendly goodies and enhancements common to other modern remasterings.  
     The main purpose of the accompanying source code repository is to study, comment upon, and repair functional errors.
It is important to record, for posterity's sake, the methods used for restoring the game to an error-free state.
Finally, the source code documents many differences and changes between the various Japanese and English releases.

Read the ["Guide to New Player Functions"](https://github.com/jojobear13/shinpokered/blob/master/ips_patches/Guide_to_New_Player_Functions.md) for instructions on all the new stuff the player can do.

Don't like the non-vanilla changes? Prefer only the bugfixes and AI improvements? Want a codebase from which to launch your own rom hack?
Then the [Lite branch](https://github.com/jojobear13/shinpokered/tree/lite) is what you want. Head on over and start compiling.

Oh Snap! Check out the [Master_dev](https://github.com/jojobear13/shinpokered/tree/master_dev) and [Lite_dev](https://github.com/jojobear13/shinpokered/tree/lite_dev) branches for beta patches and development builds.

Feel free to discuss this project in its dedicated [Pokecommunity thread](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=427398).

#Patch Info  
-----------
BPS patches are provided for entry into your preferred emulator, patching tool, or other accessory that supports the BPS format.  
Download and enter a patch which corresponds to the ROM of which you own a lawful copy.  
- **Red patches (Shin Pokemon Red, Red_origback, and Red-JP) are intended for USA Red.**
  - MD5 Hash: 3d45c1ee9abd5738df46d2bdda8b57dc
- **All other patches (Blues and Greens) are intended for USA Blue.**
  - MD5 Hash: 50927e843568814f7ed45ec4f944bd8b
- The "_origback" patches are alternatives that keep the original back sprites. 


***Includes Pokemon Green and Japanese Red!***
- The compiler primarily builds the graphics and cerulean cave layout back to the original japanese release.
- Pokedex entries adapt the original Green version text that was translated in Fire Red.
- Pokedex uses metric units.

***Includes Japanese Blue!***
- Primarily builds the lists for encounters, trades, and prizes that were in the never-localized japanese release.
- Pokedex uses metric units.
- Other minor graphical adjustments.

***Updating Your Save File***
Deactivate all special options and NPC toggles in the old save if it's from an earlier patch.  
When loading an old save file with the latest patch, the player is automatically warped to Pallet Town.  
Normally this will be enough to update the save file without doing anything else.  
It's possible you may still have issues upon loading a save from a previous patch or an unpatched game.  
To prevent this from happening, save in the outdoor Pallet Town map on the old save.  
You might be blocked by invisible walls upon loading the game.  
To fix this, you must use the Softlock Warp detailed below to teleport back to Pallet Town.

#Summary
-----------

***Lite features for a cleaned-up purist experience***

A huge number of bugs, glitches, oversights, and text errors of all sorts have been fixed. 
There are too many to enumerate in a simple summary, and some of them are very obscure or previously undiscovered.

Includes english builds of Green and Red-JP versions. 
It swaps the graphics, Cerulean Cave layout, and a few lines of text to replicate the original japanese releases.
The original release pokedex entries have been adapted from the Fire Red translations.
It also has all the pokedex data in metric.

Includes an english build of Blue-JP version.
It swaps prizes, trades, wild encounter data, and some text to replicate the original japanese release.
It also has all the pokedex data in metric.

Engine features from USA Yellow version have been backported.
No more duochrome! Yellow's color scheme gets converted to display on the Gameboy Color.
Attack animations are colored according to type during Gameboy Color play.
Yellow's audio engine is backported for stereo sound support. 

New options that can be toggled!
- Hit SELECT on the options screen to cycle through the audio output types.
- Playing in GBC mode on a backlit LCD screen? Press SELECT at the copyright screen to activate color correction.
- Experimental 60FPS Mode: Place the cursor over CANCEL in the options screen and toggle by pressing left or right.
- Zero-Delay Text: Text with zero frame delay can be toggled in the options menu; press LEFT with the cursor on FAST.

Trainer AI has been improved and greatly expanded. 
Some trainers will even try to switch pokemon intelligently.

You get notified when a box is filled (either via catching or depositing a pokemon).

Switching out of a trapping move wastes the trapper's turn. 
This prevents unbeatable AI scenarios as well as a PP underflow glitch.

Rage is limited to 2-3 turns but attack boosts are kept.
This is primarily to prevent infinite battle loops.

Sleep does not prevent choosing a move, and the move is used upon waking up.
To maintain sleep move accuracy, sleep starts with a counter of at least 2.
And Rest now sets the sleep counter to 3.   
   
   
***Additional Master features that go beyond engine modifications and fixes***

All 151 pkmn are available in one version (rarities may vary per version).

You can play as a boy or a girl.

There's an EXP bar in battle.

You can hunt for shiny pokemon, and they are valid with Gen 2 games.

No more grinding wild pokemon. Nearly all trainers can be rematched just by talking to them once or twice.

The "SET" battle style gives increased difficulty by making the stats of trainer pokemon more on your level.
It also doubles the effect of the X-stat items that AI trainers are fond of.
And it disallows the use of Revive items in battle.
Finally, it makes catching a wild Mewtwo more challenging.
As compensation, SET mode gives an additional 1.5x EXP boost in trainer battles.

You can choose RUN while holding SELECT in trainer battles to forfeit the match and black yourself out.

One of the aides in Oak's lab toggles scaling of trainer rosters to your level (evolving them if applicable).

As an alternative to trainer scaling, there is now an obedience level-cap that can be toggled in the options menu.
With the cursor in the BATTLE STYLE section, press A to toggle it on and off.
While active, the current maximum obedience level will display in the options menu.
All pokemon, not just trades, will start to disobey if over the displayed level cap.

The other aide in Oak's lab toggles a pokeball-caught symbol in battle after obtaining the pokedex.
To help with Gen 2 interaction, this also applies a gender symbol to species that can be male or female.

Another aide npc is in the Viridian pokemon center. He will toggle on/off randomization of non-special trainers.

An aide is in the Celadon Diner. He will toggle on/off a catch-up EXP boost function for under-leveled pokemon.

Item, Sleep, and Freeze clauses can each be toggled by the Clause Brothers in Viridian City.
 
The bag now supports an additional item list for an extra 20 slots of space!
Press START on the bag menu to hot-swap the item list that populates the active bag.
The game's systems will generally detect items in the non-active bag space.
Unique systems, such as Pokemon Stadium, will only recognize the active bag's item list.

Each pokemon on your team has a field move slot. 
These slots can temporarily hold a HM move for overworld-use only.
No longer do you have to sacrifice one of your four moves for a HM move.

An experimental New Game+ has been added.
It can be enabled if you have an uncorrupt save file wherein the Elite 4 have been beaten.
Press and hold SELECT while choosing New Game; a jingle confirms activation.

Lots of quick-key features.
- Quick 'Owned' Check - Place the cursor over FIGHT and press Select to play the enemy 'mon cry if it's already owned.
- Softlock Warp - Instantly teleport back to your mom's house if you get stuck.
- Running Shoes - Hold B to double your speed when walking, surfing, and biking. Includes proper animation speed-up!
- Quick HM Use - Press SELECT to use HMs based on proper context.
- Quick Bike/Rod - Press SELECT while holding A to automatically get on/off your bike or use the best rod in your inventory.
- View Stat EXP - Hold SELECT and enter the status screen to print a 'mons stat exp.
- View DVs - Hold START and enter the status screen to print a 'mons DVs.
- View Shiny Palette - When playing in color, hold SELECT when choosing a 'dex entry to load the shiny palette.
  
New NPCs!
- The move relearner and deleter is in Saffron City.
- An NPC in the Celadon Hotel will pay COINS for showing him pokemon as an alternative to slots.
- After the Elite-4, a new vendor opens up in Celadon allowing the purchase of normally unique items.
- After the Elite-4, there is an NPC in the east-west underground path that generates random trainer battles.
- After the Elite-4, the game corner chief will buy pokemon from the player.
- There's a tournament being held in the SS Anne's kitchen after the Elite-4 are beaten. Yes, the ship returns!
- Added some special post-game trainer battles as fun little easter eggs. Can you find and defeat all five?

Changes to fishing!
- The Good Rod has an expanded 'mon list and level range.
- Level range of the super rod has been increased.
- The Old Rod now randomly acts as a Good rod 50% of the time.
- The Old Rod is a sellable non-key item with the value of a nugget.
- The Route 12 Fishing Guru can be visited upon first reaching Lavender Town.
- The locations of the Good and Super Rod have been swapped.

Other minor changes to lessen annoyance.
- Low HP alarm only plays three times then turns itself off.
- TMs and HMs now have their attacks (albeit abbreviated) appended to the item names.
- All TMs can be repurchased as they are strategically scattered across all the Kanto pokemarts.
- The safari zone mechanics run off level instead of speed and safari balls have a boosted catch rate.
- Slot machines are a little more lucky, so now you can actually win big.
- CUT is not needed to get to Lt. Surge and Erika (a blocking event replaces the Vermilion shrub).
- Yellow version learnsets have been integrated and stone evolutions gain back some level-up moves.
- Hitting with a trapping move reduces its user's speed by 25% until recalculated via some other effect.
- Trapping moves play a 'poof' animation on the move's final turn in order to inform the player.

Cheats and Secrets!
- A pokemon with Pay Day in your top slot will tip you off to a lucky slot machine and when it's in a special payout mode.
- New item, M.GENE, re-randomizes a pkmn's DVs to values of 9,8,8,8 or more.
- Defeat all five post-game special trainers to reactivate the legendary pokemon.
- To more easily find shiny pokemon, put a level-100 Chansey at the top of your roster. Use a repel if you wish!
- Do you dare to activate Missingno at the Cinnabar shore? Only if you got your 'dex diploma.
- Winning the SS Anne's tournament with a pikachu in your party makes that pikachu eligible for the SURF HM.

    - substitute will not work if it would bring you to exactly 0 hp
    - zero power moves that inflict stat-downs, sleep, or paralyze will not affect a substitute

	- recoil damage from jump kicks or hurting oneself in confusion is now applied to user's substitute
  - healing moves work with restoring exactly 255 or 511 hp

     - undoes the stat changes of burn and paralysis
  - fixed-damage move fixes (seismic toss, dragon rage, etc):
    - can no longer critically hit
    - obey type immunities
	- ignore effectiveness text & sfx
	- use 2 bytes for damage instead of 1
  - Struggle is now TYPELESS so that it can always neutrally damage something

  - Bide's accumulated damage bytes are now both set to zero on an enemy faint in order to prevent desync

  - Hyper beam must recharge if it knocks out the opposing pkmn
  - Bugfixes involving Counter:
    - works against BIRD type, which is now typeless and assigned only to STRUGGLE
    - To prevent desync, pressing B to get out of the move selection menu zeros-out the ram location for selected move & move power
    - last damage dealt is zeroed in these cases (also fixes some issues with Bide):
	  - it's the start of the round without a trapping move active (fixes most issues since Counter always goes second)
	  - player/enemy pkmn is fully paralyzed or after hurting itself in confusion
    - Crash damage from jump kicks and pkmn hurting itself cannot be Countered
  - To prevent infinite loops, Rage ends after 2 to 3 turns (attack boosts are kept)
  - Non-link enemy mons now have PP, so always run checks for 0 PP during the disable effect
  - Fixed an issue with Disable's counter on slower 'mons

  
- Graphical Fixes
  - Gym leader names have been restored on the trainer card
    - These were removed during localization as a simple and expedient solution
    - So this is more of a correction to the localization than a strict graphical error

	- Looks like the idea was dropped in development due to issues with having separate audio banks
	- However, there is a unique unused sfx in the battle audio bank that signifies getting some kind of important item
	- This is likely what was going to be used for getting a badge at some point, and it has been restored

#TWEAKS:
-----------

  - Correct type effectiveness information & sfx should now be displayed when attacking dual-type pkmn

- Adjustments to moves  
  - Stat-down moves no longer have a 25% miss chance in AI matches
  - Moves that hit multiple times in a turn now calculate damage and critical hits for each individual attack
  - Trapping moves nerfed big time to prevent the new AI from cheesing them:
    - Switching out of a trapping move ends it immediately and wastes its user's turn (prevents PP underflow glitch too)
	- Each time a trapping move is used and hits, user's speed reduced 25% until recalculated through other mechanics
    - A 'poof' animation plays to signal the last turn of the trapping move
  - Ghost moves (i.e. just Lick) do 2x against psychic as was always intended
  - Pay Day upped to 5x multiplier of later generations
  - Changes to Bide
    - damage accumulation is done after taking a damaging hit instead of during turn execution (less room for glitches)

	- changed to Typeless to play nicer with AI routine 3 (it ignores the type chart regardless)
  - Rest's sleep condition increased to 3 turns since attacking on wakeup is now allowed.

	- As a tradeoff, attack boosts from rage are kept when it ends

- Adjustment to stat mods, conditions, and items
  - Sleep does not prevent choosing a move
  - Waking up from sleep does not waste the turn and the chosen move is used
    - The sleep counter's minimum value is increased by +1 to maintain accuracy of sleep moves
  - Badge stat-ups are now only applied in wild pokemon battles to give parity to enemy trainers (only in "SET" style)
  - The effect of X Accuracy is no longer applied to one-hit K.O. moves (it originally made them auto-hit)
  - The limiter on vitamins is raised to a max of 62720 stat exp after the elite 4 have been beaten
  - Pkmn added to the player's party (either as a gift or in-game trade) have at the least DVs of 9,8,8,8
  - Upped the power of safari balls
  - Escaping in the safari zone is now based on level instead of speed
  - In "SET" style, X-stat items have double the effect
  
- Trainer ai routine #1 (recognition of stats, hp, and conditions) has been modified
  - using a move with a dream eater effect is heavily discouraged against non-sleeping opponents
  - using a move with a dream eater effect is slightly encouraged against a sleeping opponent
  - using a zero-power confusion effect move is heavily discouraged against confused opponents
  - moves that would miss against an active substitute are heavily discouraged
  - stat buff/debuffs are heavily discouraged if it would have no effect due to hitting the buff/debuff stage limit
  - heavily discourage double-using lightscreen, reflect, mist, substitute, focus energy, and leech seed
  - leech seed won't be used against grass pkmn
  - do not use moves that would be blocked by an active mist effect

    - heavily discourage healing if at max hp
	- slightly encourage healing if below 1/3 hp
	- slightly discourage healing if above 1/2 hp
  - heavily discourage using Counter against a non-applicable move
  - heavily discourage roar, teleport, & whirlwind
  - heavily discourage disable against a pkmn already disabled
  - Substitute discouraged if less that 1/4 hp remains
  - Will discourage using Haze if unstatus'd or has net-neutral or better stat mods
  - Discourages explosion moves in proportion to HP remaining
  - Will heavily discourage boosting defense against special, OHKO, or static-damaging attacks
  - AI layer changes that affect most 0-power moves (with only a few exceptions like heal effects)
    - now has a hard stop on using 0-power moves on consecutive turns with a few effect exceptions
	- heavily discourages 0-power moves if below 1/3 hp
  - Discourage exploding effects if faster than a player in fly/dig state
  - Randomly discourage usage of 2-turn moves when confused/paralyzed
  - 50% chance that the AI is blind to a player switching or using an item

- Trainer ai routine #3 (choosing effective moves) has been modified
  - It now heavily discourages moves that would have no effect due to type immunity
  - OHKO moves are heavily discouraged if the ai pkmn is slower than the player pkmn (they would never hit)

  - Thunder Wave is not used against immune types
  - Poisoning moves discouraged against poison types

  - 12.5% chance to switch if a move is disabled
  - 12.5% chance to switch if afflicted with leech seed
  - 34% chance to switch if afflicted with toxic poison
  - 25% chance to switch if opponent is using a trapping move
  - 25% chance to switch if active pkmn is confused
  - on the lowest stat mod, 12.5% chance to switch per lowered stage
  - There is a chance for the AI to switch a sleeping pokemon based on the sleep counter
    -chance is 0% if counter <= 3
	-chance is 12.5% if counter > 3
  - Additionally, every pokemon in the enemy roster is scored 
    - based on various criteria to determine which mon gets sent out
	- score might dictate that the current mon is the best choice and abort switching
	- an enemy mon is flagged when sent out; non-volatile (except sleeping) status or low hp cannot initiate switching
	- enemy mon that is recalled back due to a super effective move is flagged; it is demerited from being switched-in
	- switch flags are all cleared when player sends out a new mon since the situation is now different
  - AI scoring for switching puts a heavier penalty on potentially switching in a bad type matchup
  - AI scoring imposes a very heavy penalty for potentially switching in pokemon with less than 1/4 HP
  - AI switch scoring now penalizes bad match-ups between player and enemy 'mon types
  
- Trainer ai routine #3 added to the following trainer classes

  - Attack DV is between 9 and 15 and always odd-numbered
  - Defense, special, and speed DVs are between 8 and 15
  - HP DV is a minimum of 8 since attack DV is always odd-numbered
- Trainer AI battles now track which enemy pkmn have already been sent out, so allows for new functionality:
  - Trainer pkmn DVs are remembered between switching, and new ones won't be generated on every send-out
  - Trainer pkmn now have stat experience assigned to them that is scaled to their level (only in "SET" style)
  - These are real DVs and statEXP values that utilize the existing enemy party_struct which is normally unused by trainer AI
- Special trainers, e4, and gym leaders are slightly adjusted in their item use
- Agatha & cooltrainers will not randomly switch since they now have ai routine 4
- Flags for dividing exp among active pokemon are now only reset after fainting an enemy pkmn
  - Originally these get reset every time the opponent send out a pkmn (even swithing)
  - Was never really noticed since most trainers never switch nor would have the opportunity
  - Changed based on user feedback since many trainers now try to switch

  - Improved exp calculation for developers who want a level cap between 101 and 255
    - EXP calculation routine now does math in 4 bytes instead of 3 bytes
	- Exp calculation result is still capped to 3 bytes regardless of level cap to prevent overflow
	- The byte cap on the exp result means that certain growth rates may have a level cap
	- For example, the "slow" growth rate is theorized to cap at level 237
  - Trainer battle prize money uses 3 bytes instead of 2, lifting the 9999 cap on winnings

#About Gameshark Codes
----------------------
Will they work? Largely, yes...with some rules.  
Shin Pokemon does not reassign any wram or hram addresses, so cheat codes that modify values within these address ranges will still work.  
The GB/C's wram is in addresses C000-DFFF, and hram is in FF80-FFFE.  

Gameshark codes for the GB/C have an 8-digit hexadecimal format in the form of LMNOYZWX. The meaning of the separate digits is:  
- LM - External RAM bank number (typically 01)
- NO - a 2-digit byte to act as your injected value
- WXYZ - A 2-byte Memory Address to write the new value to (Note that the gameshark code format reverses the low and high bytes of the address)

So say you want a cheat code that gives you 99 of the first item in the bag.  
The quantity of the first item in the bag is at address D31F in wram, and 99-decimal equals 63-hex.  
This gives a gameshark code of 01631FD3.  

Any codes that follow these conventions and only modify the wram or hram should work like they do in the vanilla games.  


#Will Not Implement / Out of Scope
-----------------------------------
These are things that are commonly requested but fall outside the scope of the project. There are no plans to implement these:  
- Yellow Version - This is a different rom base, and I have no intention at this time to start all over on numerous features.
- Gen 2 color / graphics - The goal is to keep art direction and assets within the purview of a pre-1998 direction.
- Battle mechanics from later generations - Gen 1's gameplay must be generally be preserved, so no special defense, physical-special split, critical hits untied from speed, updated move pools, etc.
- Later-gen evolutions/forms/variants - I'm keeping this strictly to the original 151.


#Frequently Asked Questions
---------------------------
> **I love your work! How can I donate to you?**

The gesture is appreciated and highly flattering, but donations of any sort are politely declined.
	
> **What are the best ways to support Shin Pokemon?**

There are several ways you can support the project:
- Stream your playthrough.
- Make a Let's Play series.
- Do a review or an analysis piece.
- Create highly detailed bug reports with an "Issues" ticket.
- Recording and uploading your gameplay is the best resource for troubleshooting. Let's Plays and stream VODs are routinely searched for and examined. 

> **How do you come up with with new features and their implementations?**

It's primarily based on nostalgic schoolyard rumors, interesting "what if" ideas, and love for secrets and easter eggs from the 1990s gaming era.

> **A separate project used code from Shin Pokemon to do such-and-such feature. Will you backport it into Shin Pokemon?**

Let such projects have their own identity. Other creators need to be able to show off and be proud of what they made.

> **Why did you not use the artwork of Trainer Green from the Adventures comic or the Let's Go games for the female trainer option?**

Internal debate was heated on how to proceed for a female player option, but here's the reasoning that won out:
- Green's design was never intended to be a playable character. Ken Sugimori created her back-view because he needed to depict a trainer trio for an art piece.
- Trainer Red was always supposed to be the player. An original female trainer was never considered until gen-2's development phase around Nov-Dec 1997.
- Others already created original sprite art to include in their own projects, and lifting it might step on their toes or foster ill feelings.

So it was decided to whip-up something simple and original that depicted a female version of Trainer Red. She also acts as a (private) dev shoutout.

> **Why can Bide still hit opponents in the Fly/Dig state when Pokemon Stadium fixes this?**

Bide is a crummy move, but it gains a little more strategy in Shin Pokemon. This oversight was purposefully retained as a "feature" to help it out some more.

> **Why does Hyper Beam recharge work like it does in gen-2 instead of always needing to recharge like in Stadium?**

Shin Pokemon did do always-recharge at one point, but it was hated by *literally every player*. Removing recharge on a miss was done as a compromise.

> **Why is there a brief white frame flash when the screen transitions on Gameboy Color?**

It's a hardware quirk. There is a brief moment where the LCD is disabled. When it is re-enabled, the screen displays blank white for 1 frame.
